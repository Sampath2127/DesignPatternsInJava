Open Closed Principle:
-
Open Closed principle states that software modules should be open for extension and closed for modification.

- Functionalities should be built in such a way that the code can be scaled but not required to be rebuilt or modified and existing unit test case should succeed.
- This principle helps in avoiding fragile design.

Strategy Pattern:
-
- Open Closed principle promotes a widely used industry pattern named Strategy Pattern. 
- This pattern enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.
